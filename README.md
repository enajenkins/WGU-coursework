# WGU Bachelor of Science, Software Engineering (BSSE - Java)

## Coursework, Projects, Notes Archive

The purpose of this archive is to both: demonstrate my skills and competencies; and provide an additional study resource to students and others learning the topics covered. Most of the information in the notes is a result of independent study and outside resources. 

Directories will typically follow the format:

* README.md: overview of the course
* notes-and-study-resources.md: the notes I took and resources I used to learn the material
* /project-folder
  - README.md: project documentation (description, usage, scenario, requirements, doc structure, etc...)
  - project files: documents or directories for course project
- /practice-exercises
  - README.md: list of exercises and practice skills covered
