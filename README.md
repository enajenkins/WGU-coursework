# WGU Bachelor of Science, Software Engineering (BSSE - Java)

## Coursework, Projects, Notes Archive

### **The purpose of this archive is to:**

1. house and deploy projects and code for instructor evaluation;
2. further demonstrate my skills and competencies;
3. and provide an additional study resource to students and others learning the topics covered.

During my studies at WGU I found that I often needed alternative resources to support my learning process. Most of the information in my notes is a result of independent study and outside resources. 

### **Directories will typically follow the format:**

* ```README.md:``` overview of the course
* ```notes-and-study-resources.md:``` the notes I took and resources I used to learn the material
* ```/project-folder```
  - ```README.md:``` project documentation (description, usage, scenario, requirements, doc structure, etc...)
  - ```project files:``` documents or directories for course project
- ```/practice-exercises```
  - ```README.md:``` list of exercises and practice skills covered
